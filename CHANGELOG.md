- Merge (#14): fix(scripts): harden jq handling and improve agent execution stability

This change improves robustness and portability of deckrd-related scripts,
especially in environments where jq may be missing and scripts are executed
by agents.

- skills/deckrd/scripts/init-dirs.sh:
  - Require jq only when updating session data and fail fast if missing
  - Remove `set -u` to stabilize error handling during agent execution
  - Add script metadata and license header

- skills/deckrd/scripts/run-prompt.sh:
  - Load session settings via jq when available, with grep/sed fallback
  - Emit a clear warning when fallback parsing is used
  - Disable `set -u` to avoid unintended aborts in agent runs

- scripts/create-release.sh:
  - Safely manage TZ by exporting UTC temporarily and restoring afterward
  - Normalize command existence checks for zip, jq, and rsync
  - Make LICENSE* detection robust against unexpanded globs
- Bump version to 0.0.2 and update documentation
